# Genetic_Algorithm_Himmelblau_Function_Optimization
This project implements a Genetic Algorithm to optimize the Himmelblau function. It demonstrates population evolution using selection, crossover, and mutation, visualizing convergence and the final solutions on a contour plot to show how GA finds global minima in a complex search space.
